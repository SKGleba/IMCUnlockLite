# Introduction:
This mod allows you to _permanently_ add a internal ux0 storage (imc) to the PSVita 1000 by modifying boot data regions.

# Installation:
1) Download and install the provided VPK file. If you are using ENSO NSKBL hack, make sure that the correct enso installer is installed (You can grab a universal one from here: https://github.com/SKGleba/IMCUnlock/tree/master/enso-installers), DO NOT SKIP THAT STEP!.

2) Disable all unnecessary plugins and reboot.

3) Now, we will install the mod. Open IMCUnlock, accept the agreement and select "Enable/Disable the internal mc" .

4) A prompt asking if you are sure that you want to flash IMCUnlock will appear. After preesing "Yes" the installer will start the flash process.

5) DO NOT TOUCH THE DEVICE UNTIL IT FINISHES (1-3 secs)

6) After flashing, the following screen should appear:

7) If you are a user of ENSO NSKBL hack - launch the enso installer and install enso (DO NOT SKIP THAT STEP!), otherwise - reboot.

8) If your vita reboots fine - thats it, you can format the new memory via system settings!

 # Useful notes:
- Instead of removing, the internal ux0 partition is disabled (to prevent syscon from blocking the original memory cards after a user uninstalls it without having a sony mc inserted). You can remove it fully using IMCUnlock's 0mb option.
